# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE_DATA

I did this project in collaboration with UNP. The Brazillion E-Commerce Dashboard provides insights into sales, customer demographics, and financial performance. It analyzes total purchases, delivery times, product categories, and pricing. Customer data visualizations include state-wise distribution, locations, and unique customer counts. Order trends, statuses, and processing times are tracked for performance evaluation. The dashboard also covers payment analysis, showing methods, installments, and total payment values. Review scores, comments, and averages help assess customer feedback. Financial insights include revenue trends and freight cost distribution. Slicers enable detailed analysis, enhancing data-driven decision-making.
